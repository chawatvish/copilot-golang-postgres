# Project Structure Refactor

## Overview

The project has been refactored from a single-file monolith to a well-organized, layered architecture following Go best practices and clean architecture principles.

## New Project Structure

```

## Architecture Layers

### 1. **cmd/server** - Application Entry Point

- **Purpose**: Main application bootstrap and dependency injection
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initialize all components
  - Wire dependencies together
  - Start the HTTP server

### 2. **internal/handlers** - HTTP Layer

- **Purpose**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Responsibilities**:
  - HTTP request/response handling
  - Input validation
  - Status code management
  - Route parameter extraction

### 3. **internal/services** - Business Logic Layer

- **Purpose**: Core business logic and rules
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Business rules enforcement
  - Data transformation
  - Orchestrate repository calls
  - Transaction management (future)

### 4. **internal/repository** - Data Access Layer

- **Purpose**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data CRUD operations
  - Data source abstraction
  - Query optimization
  - Database connection management (future)

### 5. **internal/models** - Data Models

- **Purpose**: Data structures and DTOs
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data models definition
  - JSON serialization tags
  - Validation rules
  - Request/Response DTOs

### 6. **internal/router** - Routing Configuration

- **Purpose**: HTTP route setup and middleware
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Route definitions
  - Middleware configuration
  - Group route organization

### 7. **pkg/response** - Shared Utilities

- **Purpose**: Reusable packages that can be imported by external projects
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Standardized API response format
  - Common utility functions
  - Shared data structures

### 8. **tests** - Test Suite

- **Purpose**: Integration and API tests
- **Responsibilities**:
  - End-to-end testing
  - API contract testing
  - Integration testing

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- Each layer has a single responsibility
- Clear boundaries between layers
- Easy to test individual components

### 2. **Dependency Injection**

- Components depend on interfaces, not implementations
- Easy to mock for testing
- Flexible for future changes (e.g., database integration)

### 3. **Standardized Responses**

- Consistent API response format
- Better error handling
- Improved client experience

### 4. **Thread Safety**

- Repository layer uses mutex for thread-safe operations
- Concurrent request handling

### 5. **Scalable Structure**

- Easy to add new features
- Clear place for each type of code
- Follows Go community standards

## Benefits

### **Maintainability**

- Code is organized by functionality
- Easy to locate and modify specific features
- Clear separation makes debugging easier

### **Testability**

- Each layer can be unit tested independently
- Dependency injection enables easy mocking
- Clear interfaces make testing straightforward

### **Scalability**

- Easy to add new endpoints or features
- Can easily swap implementations (e.g., database)
- Microservice-ready architecture

### **Team Development**

- Multiple developers can work on different layers
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Reduced merge conflicts

### **Code Reusability**

- Business logic is separate from HTTP concerns
- Repository pattern allows multiple data sources
- Services can be reused across different handlers

## Migration Summary

### Before

- Single `main.go` file with 200+ lines
- All logic mixed together
- Hard to test individual components
- Difficult to extend or modify

### After

- 8 focused files with clear responsibilities
- Clean architecture with proper separation
- Easy to test each layer independently
- Simple to add new features or modify existing ones

The refactored structure follows industry best practices and makes the codebase production-ready, maintainable, and scalable.
